See the readme for the whole playbook. its better explained there!
But in short it exists here as well.

#pip install passlib

# use passlib to generate a hashed password.
python -c "from passlib.hash import sha512_crypt; import getpass; print sha512_crypt.encrypt(getpass.getpass())"

# It will ask for your password
# Now type the password, and it will return with the hashed string.
# save that hashed string.

edit the ansible/playbooks/inovia_users/roles/rootpwd/tasks/main.yml file with
the ansible-vault command:

ansible-vault edit main.yml

change the password on the password to the hashed string you just created.
and save the file.

And importantly! You have to update the vaultfile where Operations stores all passwords.
Update the inovia vault file with the password! Not the hashed one..
If you dont do that, we have no record of what root password we have on the system.

ansible-vault edit ansible/etc/passwords/passwords.txt

Update the password under the text:
# current root password updated by inovia_users playbook on all inovia linux servers
